If an event type chages, which would be for recurrance purposes, it removes all alterations. You can alter generated events and they will be stored as alteration events that match the timestamp of the generated event. This timestamp should be checked while generating and not generate the event that was altered. Altered events will be generated independently and point to the original event type.
